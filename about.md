### 🏁 First of all

I originally built this page because I rejected the idea of maintaining several
dating site profiles. This way I just have to put a link to this page.

## Let the info dump begin

### 👪 Childrens

I am the part-time parent of two (9 and 7 years old).

### 💘 Things I could never do without

- **Companionship**. Feeling remarkably comfortable as myself around someone else.
- **Being understood/accepted**. Sharing a similar sense of humor. No fear of sideways glances when revealing interests or thoughts.
- **Affirmation/trust**. Words and actions that show me that you truly give a damn about me.
- **Alone time**. A certain amount. Balance. How can I appreciate someone if they’re always around?
- **Affection**. TBD.

### 💼 What I’m doing with my life

- Software engineer.
- Learning to juggle all that adulthood throws at me.
- I collect some things. Not like a crazy completionist collector. More of a stingy and selective one. Mostly video game-related stuff and comic books.
- Learning languages. [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/radsectors)

### 💯 I’m really good at

- **Computers**. Y’know how “Donatello does machines?” Well, Marc does computers.
- **Humor** Laughing at my own jokes. Talking to myself. Coming up with obscure wordplay jokes that I can’t use because they take more time to explain than to deliver.
- **Adulting** Pretending to be a grownup.

### 🤔 I spend a lot of time thinking about…

- Mental health
- How do adults meet new people and make friends?
- What I can do to enjoy life more and get more out of it?
- What language should I study next?
- What happened to Elisa Lam?
