<h3>🏁 First of all</h3>
<p>
    I&#8217;m <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://wiki.asexuality.org/Quoiromantic" target="_blank">quoiromantic</a>,
    which basically means I don&#8217;t recognize the lines between romance and friendship. I don&#8217;t understand
    romantic attraction and really couldn&#8217;t tell you whether or not I experience it.
</p>


<h3>🎯 Seeking</h3>
<p>
    New friends, mainly. Nothing serious, but open to whatever happens.<br>Any mix of the following: Companionship, good
    conversation, snuggles, the warmth of another&#8217;s body.
</p>


<h3>👪 Childrens</h3>
<p>
    I am the part-time parent of two (9 and 7 years old). I have them only a few evenings during the week and one full
    day on the weekend. I would not press for you to meet, speak to, care for, or even acknowledge them unless you
    wished to. Obviously, if things became more serious, it would be nice if you at least liked them. But let&#8217;s
    not get ahead of ourselves.
</p>


<h3>💘 Things I could never do without</h3>
<p>
    • <strong>Companionship</strong>. Feeling remarkably comfortable as myself around someone else.<br>
    • <strong>Alone time</strong>. A certain amount. Balance. How can I appreciate someone if they&#8217;re always around?<br>
    • <strong>Affection</strong>. Physical touch and intimacy. I like touching and being touched.<br>
    • <strong>Affirmation/trust</strong>. Words and actions that show me that you truly give a damn about me.<br>
    • <strong>Being understood/accepted</strong>. Sharing a similar sense of humor. No fear of sideways glances when revealing unusual interests or thoughts.
</p>


<h3>💼 What I&#8217;m doing with my life</h3>
<p>
    • Software engineer.<br>
    • Learning to juggle all that adulthood throws at me.<br>
    • I collect some things. Not like a crazy completionist collector. More of a
    stingy and selective one. Mostly video game-related stuff and comic books.<br>
    • Learning languages. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.duolingo.com/radsectors" target="_blank">Duolingo</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.memrise.com/user/radsectors/courses/learning/" target="_blank">Memrise</a>.
</p>


<h3>💯 I&#8217;m really good at</h3>
<p>
    • <strong>Computers</strong>. Y&#8217;know how “Donatello does machines?” Well, Marc does computers.<br>
    • <strong>Humor</strong> Laughing at my own jokes. Talking to myself. Coming up with obscure wordplay jokes that take more time to explain than to deliver.<br>
    • <strong>Adulting</strong> Pretending to be a grownup.
</p>


<h3>🤔 I spend a lot of time thinking about…</h3>
<p>
    • What I can do to enjoy life more and get more out of it?<br>
    • What language should I study next?<br>
    • How do adults make new friends?
</p>
