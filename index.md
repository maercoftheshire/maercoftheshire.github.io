I’m a software engineer based in Aurora, Illinois.

I enjoy coding, burrito bowls, and spiked seltzer.

I love K-pop, music, language, video games, and art.

I hate ignorance, xenophobia & racism, sexism, homophobia, toxic masculinity, and deadlines.

I’m fascinated by things I don’t know or understand.
